Chromapper Beatmap V3


I couldnt upload the installer that had the chromapper v3 files in here because they "Exceed 25mb."

I uploaded the setup that contains all of the files you need to run v3 on mediafire:

If you dont feel safe using the installer, the mediafire below has the zip (that I was originally going to upload without the 25mb limit) that contains all the files:

If youd like to complile chromapper yourself, you can go to the developers github branch that contains it

Info:
The installer or zip, contains just chromapper, I didnt modify anything like add credits or anything. Just compliled the branch in unity. 

If you are wondering how to access the new arcs and chain notes, please go into settings\keybinds to see what the keybinds are. 

Default keybind to switchover your map from v2 to v3 is alt + shift + .

Keybinds may be subject to change.
