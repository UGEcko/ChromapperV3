# ChromapperV3
This is the ChromapperV3 unofficial github. Every update that is pushed to the Beatmap v3 Development branch will be compiled, and updated here asap.


Please go to releases and download the latest version of Cmv3.


Most people do not know how to access the beatmap v3 files, download them, load them into unity, and complile them. I did this and released it in this github.

If you are interested in compiling the beatmap v3 yourself, please head to the wiki page.
